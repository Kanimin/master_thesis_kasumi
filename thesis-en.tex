\abstract{
In recent years, sensors are small enough and their prices are getting lower.
Sensors have change to be eccentrically located.
The Internet change transfer of large data.
Thereby, large scale sensor networks have been constructible.

In this kind of sensor network, we need to consider load balancing,
network redundancy and data reliability.
Using P2P technology is one of the solutions for load balancing and
network redundancy.

In this paper, we introduce how to ensure sensor data reliability on the system.
Approach way is detect fault and grant reliability metadata to the sensor data.
In fault detection, make a group by location and reliability.
This group is used for reduce the processing time.
User can use reliability point for select request data.
Experimental result shows this approach can grant reliability correctly over
90\%.
