\section{Shifting to Creative Society}
\subsection{A WHOLE NEW MIND}

Daniel Pink~\cite{Pink2006} said that the future belongs
to a different kind of person with a different kind of mind:
artists, inventors, storytellers-creative and holistic "right-brain" thinkers
whose abilities mark the fault line between who gets ahead and who doesn't.
Drawing on research from around the world,
Pink outlines the six fundamentally human abilities
that are absolute essentials for professional success and
personal fulfillment-and reveals how to master them.
A Whole New Mind takes readers to a daring new place,
and a provocative and necessary new way of thinking about a future
that's already here.
While, we ate your bread~\cite{Sugiura2012,Uriu2012}.

\section{Design Thinking Workshop}
\subsection{IDEO}
We also ate rice~\cite{Tokuhisa2009} and bread.

\subsection{d-school}
Also Pink~\cite{Pink2006} said something about creativity.


\subsection{SDM}
Recently SDM is also conducting design thinking workshop in
the Collaboration Complex\footnote{Graduate School of System Design
  and Management, Keio University \\\url{http://www.sdm.keio.ac.jp/}}.
But {\it iias Tsukuba} (Figure~\ref{fig:iias})~\footnote{{\it iias Tsukuba}
is one of largest shopping center located in Tsukuba city.
\url{http://tsukuba.iias.jp}}
has not conducted design thinking workshop yet.

\section{DNS Performance}

It is essential to improve DNS performance without chaning the semantics
of the DNS. One of the ways is to fully make use of DNSSEC
{\tt NSEC}/{\tt NSEC3} to allow full-service resolver
to respond {\tt NXDOMAIN} immedidately
when the QNAME matches with one of the cached {\tt NSEC}/{\tt NSEC3} records.
This modification has been proposed by RFC8198~\cite{rfc8198}.
