abstract = {Book Description: The future belongs to a different kind of person with a different kind of mind: artists, inventors, storytellers-creative and holistic “right-brain” thinkers whose abilities mark the fault line between who gets ahead and who doesn’t. Drawing on research from around the world, Pink outlines the six fundamentally human abilities that are absolute essentials for professional success and personal fulfillment-and reveals how to master them. <em>A Whole New Mind</em> takes readers to a daring new place, and a provocative and necessary new way of thinking about a future that’s already here.},
